	<h3> Today Emma is not here </h3>
	
	<h3> Below is a picture of what she looks like. She is likely to be found near books, in a classroom or near stamps.
She could be possibly hugging a nasty dog or even drinking wine. If found please return to Coding Club, Year 3, Norbridge Academy, S81 7HX.
Hopefully she will be found soon! 	</h3>
