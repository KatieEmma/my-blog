<h1> Without Warning, a masculine man appeared </h1>

<h2> He goes by the name of Bellybutton, Matty Bellybutton </h2>

<p> They say his favourite things are feminine diaries and shades of teal. </p>

<p> He is generally seen clocking into school around 8:15. After a commute full of eating squares!</p>

<p> He is a jolly OLD soul despite his lack of sleep, blamed on a baby he tries to convince us that exists </p>

<p> He is seen cheerily walking round school, though when wearing his Norbridge fleece is indistinguishable from the children </p>

<p> From a popular part of Manchester (cough, cough!) he justifably supports Manchester City and is an avid follower, regulary attending matches! </p>

<p> Avoid spelling mistakes around him, which he will promptly point out to your boss!! </p>

<p> Mate, please spare a thought for the bellybutton on this cold winters night </p>
